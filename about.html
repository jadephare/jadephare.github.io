                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        I began my journey in the software engineering field in
                        2019, after earning my B.A in Symbolic Systems from
                        Stanford. I was fortunate enough to work with Microsoft,
                        where I gained invaluable experience and honed my
                        skills. My journey then led me to a Series-C startup,
                        Hipcamp, where I was quickly promoted due to my
                        dedication and hard work.

                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        In 2021, I founded "Adventure with Jade", an online
                        coaching service aimed at empowering early-career women
                        software engineers. I believe in the power of
                        personalization and empowerment, and I strive to equip
                        my clients with the tools, knowledge, and confidence
                        they need to succeed in their job search.

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">My Approach</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        My approach is centered around personalization and
                        empowerment. I offer 1-on-1 coaching, resume feedback,
                        mock interviews, and more. I believe that every
                        individual is unique, and I tailor my coaching to meet
                        the specific needs of each client.

                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                        I am committed to using my experiences and knowledge to
                        guide others. I understand the challenges that come with
                        being a woman in the software engineering field, and I
                        am dedicated to helping others overcome these challenges
                        and succeed in their careers.
